# Project Overview
[//]: # (This section is an example structure for the proposal to your client.)

>This is all sample material in here, to give you an idea on how and what to populate each section with. If you think of other sections or a different document layout, please do use it!

## Design
[//]: # (How will you meet the client's brief, their expectations, and their requirements.)

### Project Name
Not A Mario Game

### Description
[//]: # (This is the elevator pitch, sell the idea)
Players play in a 2D sidescrolling platformer similar to the classic Mario games. Walking, running and jumping their way through the level, players must avoid obstacles and or detroy the enemies else they kill the character and respawn them. They can find check points to set there spawn or collect pick ups for a temporary power boosts.

### Begin Date
4th of May

### End Date
1st of June

### Justification
Read the design justification [here](project_justification.md).

## Statement of Works
[//]: # (This section is about managing expectations; list out all of the qualities that will be in the final product)

### Requirements
[//]: # (What are the requirements of the finished project?)
* Needs the product in 5 weeks.
* Gameplay should be fast-paced
* Rounds should be short
* Should be quick to restart
* Feedback is a major point
* People should be drawn to it by it's appearance
    * Needs a catchy name

### Expectations
[//]: # (What are the client's expectations?)
* Project delivered on time
* Weekly updates on progress
* Communication with the client when design issues encountered
* Quality transparent project management (add the client)
* Does **not** require audio
* Does **not** require high quality art
    * Can use basic geometry
    * Should still look nice using colour palettes

### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* UI art does not need to be high quality, will just use basic Unity UI sprites
* Particles will be important, but since we shouldn't spend time on art, will use standard asset or free particle assets
